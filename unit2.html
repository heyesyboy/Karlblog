        I have become more competent on Visual Studio Code and Trello as the website and updates have progressed.
        The tools are vital in succeeding in this project.

        I have not used codepen a lot as I do not have access at home and while I have been here I have focused on just
        learning the basics and I have tried to expand my knowledge where possible.

        2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were
        appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen,
        Trello
        <br>
        2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your
        final project â€“ are you happy with your website?
        Why? Why not? You should review it on the
        website itself in the interests of openness. What
        would you change?
        <br>
        2.4 Describe further improvements you can make
        to your project
        <br>

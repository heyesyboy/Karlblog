                <h4>1.1 Describe the layout for each page</h4>
            </li>
            <br>
            <br>
            I tried to keep all the pages the same in terms of there design and styling as I needed consistency
            throughout the site and this helps with the user experience. But also so it would look professsional and
            draw people's attention. I hoped to provide some content with my site but not so much that it becomes
            boring.
            <br>
            <br>
            However, in discovering my limitations, It has revealed that content is not everything and style is especially
            important especially when you are working on a website.

            <br>
            <ul> Five Ways to Stay Out of Trouble
                This section provides five simple rules for your website.

                <li>Assume It’s Protected</li>
                <li>Read Click-Wrap Agreements</li>
                <li>Remove Unauthorized Material</li>
                <li>Investigate Claims Promptly</li>
                <li>When in Doubt, Seek Permission</li>
                <li>The Likelihood of Getting Caught</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>

        
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Assume It’s Protected</h4>
            <br>
            <br>
            As a general rule, it is wise to operate under the assumption that all works are protected by either
            copyright or trademark law unless conclusive information indicates otherwise. A work is not in the public
            domain simply because it has been posted on the Internet (a popular fallacy) or because it lacks a copyright
            notice (another myth). For information on these and other public domain issues, see the section, “The Public
            Domain.”
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Read Click-Wrap Agreements</h4>
            <br>
            <br>
            Do not assume that clip art, shareware, freeware, or materials labeled “royalty-free” or “copyright-free”
            can be distributed or copied without authorization. Read the terms and conditions in any “Click to Accept”
            agreements (often called click-wrap agreements) or “Read Me” files ordinarily accompanying such materials to
            be certain that your intended use is permitted.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Remove Unauthorized Material</h4>
            <br>
            <br>
            If someone complains about an unauthorized use on your website, remove the offending material immediately.
            In the case of unauthorized uploads, downloads, or links, the webmaster should disable access to the
            offending material or link. This is not to imply that you should cave in to every complaint. However, you
            should remove the material for the period during which you investigate the claim and, if necessary, consult
            with an attorney. Attempts to “contain” the damage will likely help your case should it find its way into
            court. Continuing to use the offensive material after being notified may aggravate the claim and the chances
            of your being found liable—and increase the amount of damages you may have to pay.
            <br>
            <br>
            Removal of infringing material is also an element of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), a 1998 law
            establishing that an Internet Service Provider (ISP, a company that provides Internet access to individuals
            and businesses) can avoid liability by following certain rules, including speedy removal of infringing
            material.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Investigate Claims Promptly</h4>
            <br>
            <br>
            If someone complains about an unauthorized use, investigate the claim quickly and seek evidence of copyright
            ownership and validity from the complaining person.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>When in Doubt, Seek Permission</h4>
            <br>
            <br>
            Many webmasters manage personal websites or sites for small organizations such as a local tennis team. Do
            all of the rules on copyright and permissions apply to these intimate or personal uses? For example, is
            permission needed to reproduce a photo taken by a club member, a friend, or a relative? The short answer is:
            “Legally, yes, practically, maybe.”
            <br>
            <br>
            Copyright protection extends to any original work regardless of who created it, and permission is required
            for reproduction, display, or distribution of the work. One of the main reasons for acquiring permission is
            to avoid a lawsuits.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>The Likelihood of Getting Caught</h4>
            <br>
            <br>
            As Internet commerce increases, so does the likelihood of being caught for unauthorized uses. Many companies
            such as McDonald’s, MTV, Levi’s, Marvel, Walt Disney, and Coca-Cola aggressively patrol the Web for
            infringement. Copyright owners encode music, artwork, photographs, and text with digital tags or marks that
            allow rapid tracking. If a website is controversial and angers some visitors, they may report perceived
            violations to copyright or trademark owners. Disgruntled employees are also common sources of infringement
            reports.
            <br>
            <br>
            Besides the fact that the web abounds with efficient ways of sniffing out copyright violations, the general
            rule is that the chances of an unauthorized use being discovered will increase as the site becomes more
            popular. Therefore, if the goal of a site is to increase its traffic, it should avoid unauthorized uses from
            the start as they rarely justify the potential aggravation and financial loss they can cause.<a

            <br>
            The WAI (Web Accessibility Initiative) seeks to make the internet more accessible to people with auditory,
            cognitive, neurological, physical, speech and visual impairments. This is largely accomplished through what
            the organisation calls "inclusive design." This includes some of the following features:

            Providing text alternatives for non-text content
            Presenting the same content in different ways
            Ensuring content is easy to see and hear
            Designing pages so that content appears and operates in predictable ways
            The tools that can help designers and developers create inclusive design includes web content, software and
            authoring tools.<a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4924/web-accessibility-initiative-wai"

                <h4>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites?</h4>
            </li>
            <br>
            <br>
            I have complied a list of filetypes for websites of which i have used a few.
            <br>
            <br>
            Internet File Formats

            While downloading files and viewing websites, you’ll meet up with many file formats. Most are common, and
            encountered frequently, others are more obscure and require specialist programs to open or use. Here, we
            have a list of the file types, along with the applications you’ll need to get them going on your computer.
            <ol>
                <br>
                <br>
                <li>.AVI — Audio/Video Interleaved</li>

                <li>.CSS — Cascading StyleSheet</li>

                <li>.DOC — Microsoft Word DOCument</li>

                <li>.MP3 — MPEG Layer 3 sound file</li>

                <li>.MPEG/ .MPG — Motion Picture Experts Group file</li>

                <li>.MOV/ .QT — QuickTime MOVie</li>

                <li>Streaming Media</li><a href="https://www.yourhtmlsource.com/starthere/fileformats.html"
                    class="links">[15]</a>

            </ol>
            <br>
            <br>

            This is not an exhusted list and as software, hardware and technology develops so will the filetypes.
            <br>
            In conclusion I would say that filetypes will only continue to develop and grow.

        <h1>Unit 2 Breakdown</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed in making your own website?</h4>
        <br>
        <br>
        I have become more competent on Visual Studio Code and Trello as the website has updates have progressed.
        The tools are vital in succeeding in this project. I have reviewed slack but I think it would be more useful in
        a team environment.

        I have not used codepen a lot as I do not have access at home and while I have been here I have focused on just
        learning the basics and I have tried to expand my knowledge where possible.

        I have enjoyed learning new skills and using the tools and equipment during the course and design of my website
        and I have become more competent as I have progressed throughout, my approach has definitely changed throughout
        the course.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate
            E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello</h4>
        <br>
        <br>
        The tools selected were appropriate to the task as they were already installed onto the computer and the
        information provided was all for Visual Studio Code, Codepen and Trello. This obviously helped me to decide
        which software to use.

        I enjoyed using the software and it definitely helped me to produce all my work regardless of the quality. I
        feel that the quality would improve in time as I improved on the software and my abilities improved.

        Visual Studio Code was appropriate and useful, it immediately helped me to complete the website as my source of
        information was based on visual studio code and there was nothing else available to me that would have provided
        any more information.

        Codepen would have been useful and appropriate if I had needed to code any data during my tasks. I didn’t need
        to so I didn’t utilise Codepen. But I do recognise the important of this tool, even if I have struggled to
        master it.

        Trello boards have basically defined my project from start to finish and allowed me to keep abreast of the work
        that I still needed to complete and the tasks that still required work on and completion.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project are you happy with your website?</h4>
        <br>
        <br>
        My project strengths would be my research into the content. I tried to use all the information I could to at
        least have some decent content within my website. Even if the site itself needs to look better at least the
        content is accurate, My weaknesses, of which there are many, are all in regards to my ability to code certain
        features and images and in regards to my technical prowess this could use some improvement.

        My website could use a lot of improvement and if I had an infinite time scale I would have made a number of
        improvements providing my ability allowed. I would have moving background images on each page.
        I would have created links for each column heading so I could reduce the amount of information on each page.

        In my mind it looks like someone who has just discovered the macbook and has made a decision to attempt to
        prodcue something in order to not fail the course. I course with time and a lot of paitent I would be able to
        produce something a lot better but for the purposes of this task. I am happy especially considering my prior
        knowledge of the content and tools.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h4>
        <br>
        <br>
        Further improvements to my website would be ongoing as I would want to continue to develop my site and update it
        accordingly. Every opportunity to develop the site and improve it will only enhance my chances of my site being
        viewed and accessed.

        The content can change due to improvements in the software, hardware, regulations, employment status etc.

        I wanted to have a moving image in the background but it was beyond my capability and ability at this stage in
        my coding and website design and creation.

        I could also have put links to all the social media links to also allow access to people with disabilities who
        face issues when using webpages to comply with the WAI (Web Accessibility Initiative) which seeks to make the
        internet
        more accessible to people with auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech and visual impairments. This
        is largely accomplished through what the organisation calls "inclusive design." This includes some of the
        following features:

        Providing text alternatives for non-text content
        Presenting the same content in different ways
        Ensuring content is easy to see and hear
        Designing pages so that content appears and operates in predictable ways
        The tools that can help designers and developers create inclusive design includes web content, software and
        authoring tools.

        <h4>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose?</h4>
        <br>
        <br>
        My website is fit for purpose to a point, I say this because it needs to be tested on people to see how it flows
        and react once it is on the web. It hasn’t yet been tested on any other platforms at this time so I am unsure as
        to it’s functionality on all current platforms and devices and due to the nature of the information that has
        been produced I am unsure whether I would put the website on the web at this time until I was completely happy
        with it.

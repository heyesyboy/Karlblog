        <li>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency –
            could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?
        </li>
        <br>
        The benefits of the IT tools and systems I used were unmeasurable as I do not have any equipment like this at my
        disposable. I have a very old laptop and outdated phone but the tools I used here were great and really helped
        me.

        The drawbacks were that I didn’t have access to the tools at home and I also had to learn the equipment I was
        using first and I found this very frustrating, especially due to my health issues.

        I could have been more efficient when making my website by breaking the tasks into even smaller chunks.

        Teams would have been good and bad for this task as you would have had more time to prepare content and visual
        effects. But you would have different problems to face, will the team have 1 programmer or more. If so who, who
        decides the website. Teams can reduce workload but recreate conflicts of interest so you need to ensure that you
        approach the idea with a clear plan.

        <li>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency
        </li>
        <br>
        I would improve productivity if I had access to the MacBook and all the programming from home as I could off
        work on it more, On the content and maybe learnt more skills and produce something which looked better than the
        finish product. I could off found a quieter spot in the building and just purely focused on the material and
        contents but I needed the support of my peers.
        <br>
        Efficiency would have been the same as productivity if I had access to the tools at home and not just in the
        classroom. I would off been able to get more done from home and practiced different things to include on my
        website.
        <br>
        <li>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects?
        </li>
        <br>
        If I had my time again I would use all the tools and equipment better with more of my own content and skills on
        show. Time has been a defining factor in my design and overall look of my website to date, together with a lack
        of basic knowledge of the tools and equipment that I have used but I have progressed throughout the course and I
        would like to think that I have stop asking the same thing over and over.
        My overall conclusion is that I have achieved what I could with the limited skills and experience that I have
        had during my time on the course.
        <br>
        <li>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions?</li>
        <br>
        To test the website I would get friends, family and non-computer based people to review the site and suggest
        ideas and features that they would like to see in the updated website. The danger is that your site might be
        amazing and someone could take all your ideas.

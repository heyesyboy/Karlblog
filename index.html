        <br>
        <br>
        My name is Karl Heyes, I am a single 40 years old man.
        Currently I live in Manchester but I have lived in Kuwait, Germany and across the United Kingdom. This was both
        exciting and also difficult as I had to adjust to new languages, cultures and places abroad and also make new
        friends and learn a new curriculum for school and work.
        I have also been to most of Europe including Spain, Portugal, Holland, Belgium, France, Greece and Turkey and
        some parts of North America. It is fair to say that I am a bit of a rolling stone when it comes to travelling.
        I am a big fan of Manchester City Football Club the only football team to come from Manchester.
        Music is a big part of my life whether it be listening to iTunes or online radio stations and I also like to
        play the guitar to relax, although I am self taught so I do not have all the necessary skills to take my act on
        the road.

        <h3 class="centre">My Computer Experience</h3>
        <br>
        Computers are something I have always liked and I have been interested in them since my first computer, for the
        record it was an Amstrad CPC 464. Especially as I have grown up with basic computers up to and including the
        latest consoles, PC's and smart phones and accessories. I first started using computers properly at 10 years old
        but I also got a summer job in Kuwait replacing broken mother boards in IBM P.C's with new boards.
        I also helped to update the Chertsey Marina LTD Chandlery Website.

        Code nation was an opportunity that was given to me directly from the Job centre as I am currently unemployed
        due to a Stroke that I had in my late 30's. This has affected me and my ability to do the job I had been doing
        and also other jobs going forward.
        My reason for taking this course is purely to expand my knowledge base and hopefully get into full time
        employment as I do not want to be on Universal Credit any longer than is absolutely necessary.

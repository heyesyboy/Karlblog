    <!-- My Opening Statement and profile pic-->

    <p> My name is Karl Heyes and I am a single 40 year old man.
        <br>

        Currently I live in Manchester but I have lived in Kuwait, Germany and across the United Kingdom. This was both
        exciting and also difficult as I had to adjust to new languages, cultures and places abroad and also make new
        friends and learn a new curriculum for school and work.
        <br>
        I have also been to most of Europe including Spain, Portugal, Holland, Belgium, France, Greece and Turkey and
        some parts of North America. It is fair to say that I am a bit of a rolling stone when it comes to travelling.
        <br>
        I am a big fan of Manchester City Football Club (the only football team to come from Manchester).
        <br>
        Music is a big part of my life whether it be listening to iTunes or online radio stations and I also like to
        play the guitar to relax, although I have self taught myself to play so I do not have all the necessary skills
        to take my act on the road.
        <br>
        Computers are something I have always liked and I have been interested in them since my first computer, for the
        record it was an Amstrad CPC 464. Especially as I have grown up with basic computers up to and including the
        latest consoles, PC's and smart phones and accessories. I first started using computers properly at 6 years old,
        I also got a summer job in Kuwait replacing broken mother boards in IBM P.C's with new boards. 
        <br>
        Code nation was an opportunity that was given to me directly from the Job centre as I am currently unemployed due to a Stroke that I had in my late 30's. 
        This has affected me and my ability to do the job I had been doing and also other jobs going forward.
        My reason for taking this course is purely to expand my knowledge base and hopefully get into full time
        employment I would rather be working in a growing industry in an excited environment and than be on Universal Credit any longer than is absolutely necessary.

            <h1>Unit 1 Breakdown</h1>
            <h3>Purpose of I.T. in Modern Business</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Information Technology in Globalisation</h4>Companies that survive in a competitive environment
                    usually have the operational and financial flexibility to grow locally and then internationally with
                    IT at the core of telecommunications, outsources, manufacturing and many more.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <h4>Cost Savings and Competitive Advantage</h4>Cost savings, rapid product development and process
                    improvements help companies gain and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Companies
                    can use rapid prototyping, software simulations and other IT-based systems to bring a product to
                    market cost effectively and quickly.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <h4>Information Technology and Cost Efficiencies</h4>
                    Although the initial IT implementation costs can be substantial, the resulting long-term cost
                    savings are usually worth the investment. IT allows companies to reduce transaction and
                    implementation costs. IT-based productivity solutions have allowed companies to save on the costs of
                    duplication and postage while maintaining and improving product quality and customer service.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <h4>Technology in Process Improvement</h4>
                    Process improvement is another key IT business
                    objective. Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems allow managers to review sales, costs and
                    other operating metrics on one integrated software platform, usually in real time. An ERP system may
                    replace dozens of legacy systems for finance, human resources and other functional areas, thus
                    making internal processes more efficient and cost-effective.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <h4>Information Technology in Stakeholder Integration</h4>
                    Stakeholder integration is another important
                    objective of information technology. Using global 24/7 interconnectivity, Public companies use their
                    investor relations websites to communicate with shareholders, research analysts and other market
                    participants.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <h4>Technology in Product Development</h4> I.T. speeds up the time it takes new products to
                    reach the market. Companies can write product requirements by gathering market intelligence from
                    proprietary databases, customers and sales representatives. Computer-assisted design and
                    manufacturing software speed up decision making, while collaborative technologies allow global teams
                    to work on different components of a product simultaneously. I.T. helps businesses respond quickly
                    to changing customer requirements and needs.[1]

            <h3>How to Succeed in Project Management</h3>
            <ul>
                <h3>Methods to Succeed</h3>
                <h4>Agile Method</h4>
            </ul>
            <ul>Satisfy the client and continually develop software.</ul>

            <ul>Changing requirements are embraced for the client’s competitive advantage.</ul>

            <ul>Concentrate on delivering working software frequently. Delivery preference will be placed on the
                shortest
                possible time span.</ul>

            <ul>Developers and business people must work together throughout the entire project.</ul>

            <ul>Projects must be based on people who are motivated. Give them the proper environment and the support
                that
                they need. They should be trusted to get their jobs done.</ul>

            <ul>Face-to-face communication is the best way to transfer information to and from a team.</ul>

            <ul>Working software is the primary measurement of progress.</ul>

            <ul>Agile processes will promote development that is sustainable. Sponsors, developers, and users should be
                able
                to maintain an indefinite, constant pace.</ul>

            <ul>Constant attention to technical excellence and good design will enhance agility.</ul>

            <ul>Simplicity is considered to be the art of maximising the work that is not done, and it is essential.
            </ul>

            <ul>Self-organised teams usually create the best designs.</ul>

            <ul>At regular intervals, the team will reflect on how to become more effective, and they will tune and
                adjust
                their behaviour accordingly.[2]</ul>

            <h3>Skills to Succeed in Project Management</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Communication</h4>
                </li>Did you know that 90 percent of a project manager’s time is spent communicating?
                It’s essential that project managers can effectively convey vision, ideas, goals, and issues—as well as
                produce reports and presentations, among other skills.

                Communication is a broad topic, so it’s difficult to approach it from an all-encompassing angle. A good
                place to start is by improving your presentation skills, which translates into everything from a kickoff
                meeting to a pitch to clients and stakeholders.
                <li>
                    <h4>Leadership</h4>
                </li>If you can lead, you can deliver. But most importantly, leadership is often what is missing in the
                project manager’s arsenal of highly developed technical skills. If you’re a project manager, I can
                guarantee you have felt the need to improve yourself as a leader at some point.
                <li>
                    <h4>Team Management</h4>
                </li>An effective team manager excels at administering and coordinating groups of
                individuals by promoting teamwork, delegating tasks, resolving conflict, setting goals, and
                evaluating performance.

                The basics on team management, insight on how to create a team identity, resolve conflicts, address
                poor team performance, and many other areas.
                <li>
                    <h4>Negotiation</h4>
                </li>Going back to the communication skill—a lot of this communication has to do with negotiating the
                use of resources, budgets, schedules, scope creep, and a variety of other compromises that are
                unavoidable. Knowing how to negotiate well so that all parties are satisfied is a key skill for the
                successful project manager.
                <li>
                    <h4>Personal Organisation</h4>
                </li>You cannot give what you do not have? How can you get things done and organise work for other
                people if your own personal life and projects are disorganised and going nowhere? Get organised
                personally, and you will immediately improve as a project manager.
                <li>
                    <h4>Risk management</h4>
                </li>If you can predict and create solutions to issues before they arise, you increase your chances of
                delivering projects successfully. Risks by definition are not urgent; as a result, many project managers
                fail to consider risks as seriously as they should.

        <h3>Tools to Use For a Suceessful Digital Project</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>Budget Management allows you to:</h4>
            </li>Create multiple 'what if' scenarios for planning purposes and to measure the impact of change.

            Track adjustments as the fiscal year unfolds.

            Check budgets on screen. Business rules can prevent budgets from being inadvertently exceeded for either
            accounts or projects.

            Budget for both projects and accounts.

            Create your budget using current or any previous years' budget information.

            Copy a budget from another year, quickly manipulate a budget up or down using amounts or percentages,
            and use an unlimited number of budget distribution tables.[3]

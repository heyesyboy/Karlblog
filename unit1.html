            <h3>Purpose of I.T. in Modern Business</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Information Technology in Globalisation</h4>Companies that survive in a competitive environment
                    usually have the operational and financial flexibility to grow locally and then internationally with
                    IT at the core of telecommunications, outsources, manufacturing and many more.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <h4>Cost Savings and Competitive Advantage</h4>Cost savings, rapid product development and process
                    improvements help companies gain and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Companies
                    can use rapid prototyping, software simulations and other IT-based systems to bring a product to
                    market cost effectively and quickly.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <h4>Information Technology and Cost Efficiencies</h4>
                    Although the initial IT implementation costs can be substantial, the resulting long-term cost
                    savings are usually worth the investment. IT allows companies to reduce transaction and
                    implementation costs. IT-based productivity solutions have allowed companies to save on the costs of
                    duplication and postage while maintaining and improving product quality and customer service.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <h4>Technology in Process Improvement</h4>
                    Process improvement is another key IT business
                    objective. Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems allow managers to review sales, costs and
                    other operating metrics on one integrated software platform, usually in real time. An ERP system may
                    replace dozens of legacy systems for finance, human resources and other functional areas, thus
                    making internal processes more efficient and cost-effective.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <h4>Information Technology in Stakeholder Integration</h4>
                    Stakeholder integration is another important
                    objective of information technology. Using global 24/7 interconnectivity, Public companies use their
                    investor relations websites to communicate with shareholders, research analysts and other market
                    participants.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <h4>Technology in Product Development</h4> I.T. speeds up the time it takes new products to
                    reach the market. Companies can write product requirements by gathering market intelligence from
                    proprietary databases, customers and sales representatives. Computer-assisted design and
                    manufacturing software speed up decision making, while collaborative technologies allow global teams
                    to work on different components of a product simultaneously. I.T. helps businesses respond quickly
                    to changing customer requirements and needs.[1]

                <h3>Methods to Succeed in Digital Projects</h3>
                <h4>Agile Method</h4>
            </ul>
            <ul>Satisfy the client and continually develop software.</ul>

            <ul>Changing requirements are embraced for the client’s competitive advantage.</ul>

            <ul>Concentrate on delivering working software frequently. Delivery preference will be placed on the
                shortest
                possible time span.</ul>

            <ul>Developers and business people must work together throughout the entire project.</ul>

            <ul>Projects must be based on people who are motivated. Give them the proper environment and the support
                that
                they need. They should be trusted to get their jobs done.</ul>

            <ul>Face-to-face communication is the best way to transfer information to and from a team.</ul>

            <ul>Working software is the primary measurement of progress.</ul>

            <ul>Agile processes will promote development that is sustainable. Sponsors, developers, and users should be
                able
                to maintain an indefinite, constant pace.</ul>

            <ul>Constant attention to technical excellence and good design will enhance agility.</ul>

            <ul>Simplicity is considered to be the art of maximising the work that is not done, and it is essential.
            </ul>

            <ul>Self-organised teams usually create the best designs.</ul>

            <ul>At regular intervals, the team will reflect on how to become more effective, and they will tune and
                adjust
                their behaviour accordingly.[2]</ul>

            <h4>Introduction to Idea Management</h4>

            Idea management is the ability to capture feedback or insights from internal and external stakeholders for
            the purpose of adding this feedback into future products or product releases.

            The most effective ideation software allows you to create as many ideas portals as you need. This means you
            can have one private portal to collect internal ideas, a separate public portal to collect customers ideas,
            and more. Here are some tips to consider while vetting your portals to practice ideation:

            Ensure that information is complete

            Merge duplicate ideas

            Prioritize ideas

            Promote ideas to features

            Respond to those who provide feedback[6]

            <h3>Skills to Succeed in Project Management</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Communication</h4>
                </li>Did you know that 90 percent of a project manager’s time is spent communicating?
                It’s essential that project managers can effectively convey vision, ideas, goals, and issues—as well as
                produce reports and presentations, among other skills.

                Communication is a broad topic, so it’s difficult to approach it from an all-encompassing angle. A good
                place to start is by improving your presentation skills, which translates into everything from a kickoff
                meeting to a pitch to clients and stakeholders.
                <li>
                    <h4>Leadership</h4>
                </li>If you can lead, you can deliver. But most importantly, leadership is often what is missing in the
                project manager’s arsenal of highly developed technical skills. If you’re a project manager, I can
                guarantee you have felt the need to improve yourself as a leader at some point.
                <li>
                    <h4>Team Management</h4>
                </li>An effective team manager excels at administering and coordinating groups of
                individuals by promoting teamwork, delegating tasks, resolving conflict, setting goals, and
                evaluating performance.

                The basics on team management, insight on how to create a team identity, resolve conflicts, address
                poor team performance, and many other areas.
                <li>
                    <h4>Negotiation</h4>
                </li>Going back to the communication skill—a lot of this communication has to do with negotiating the
                use of resources, budgets, schedules, scope creep, and a variety of other compromises that are
                unavoidable. Knowing how to negotiate well so that all parties are satisfied is a key skill for the
                successful project manager.
                <li>
                    <h4>Personal Organisation</h4>
                </li>You cannot give what you do not have? How can you get things done and organise work for other
                people if your own personal life and projects are disorganised and going nowhere? Get organised
                personally, and you will immediately improve as a project manager.
                <li>
                    <h4>Risk management</h4>
                </li>If you can predict and create solutions to issues before they arise, you increase your chances of
                delivering projects successfully. Risks by definition are not urgent; as a result, many project managers
                fail to consider risks as seriously as they should.

            <li>
                <h4>Budget Management allows you to:</h4>
                Create multiple 'what if' scenarios for planning purposes and to measure the impact of change.

                Track adjustments as the fiscal year unfolds.

                Check budgets on screen. Business rules can prevent budgets from being inadvertently exceeded for either
                accounts or projects.

                Budget for both projects and accounts.

                Create your budget using current or any previous years' budget information.

                Copy a budget from another year, quickly manipulate a budget up or down using amounts or percentages,
                and use an unlimited number of budget distribution tables.[3]

            Create together
            A task isn’t always one person’s responsibility. Sometimes team members need to create together. These are
            the best collaboration tools:

            <h4>12. Codingteam</h4>

            Coders can easily collaborate when writing their code through platforms like Codingteam. It offers a free

                <h4>Gantt Charts</h4>
            </li>
            A Gantt chart is a useful graphical tool which shows activities or tasks performed against time. It is also
            known as visual presentation of a project where the activities are broken down and displayed on a chart
            which makes it is easy to understand and interpret.

            A Gantt chart is a popular tool in project management. It basically drills down activities which need to be
            done by a fixed time period. It is commonly used for tracking project schedules.[5]

                <h4>Milestone Tracking</h4>
            </li>
            A project will only be hailed as a success if client expectations are fully met. Typically, these are
            expressed in terms of the scope of what’s to be delivered, its quality, the costs incurred and timescales
            achieved. Milestone tracking is the most effective way of managing the timescale element.

            Effective project planning focuses on the key deliverables, so that tasks show clearly how the work will be
            organised to achieve the delivery dates. Milestones are used to identify these key delivery dates so that,
            as the project gets underway, forecast delivery dates can be compared with committed dates. This is project
            milestone tracking.[7]

                <br>
                <li>
                    <h4>Set your purpose and goals.</h4>
                </li>
                What is the purpose of your website? Is it to gain publicity for your business? To sell your inventory?
                To rally support behind a cause? It’s important to identify your website’s purpose, as well as your
                target audience. You should also define your goals. How many visitors do you expect per month? How many
                do you expect will sign up for your newsletter? How much in sales do you expect to make? Set measurable,
                specific goals for your website that are in line with your marketing goals. An analytics tool like
                Google Analytics will allow you to monitor your website’s performance over time.

                <li>
                    <h4>Create a budget.</h4>
                </li>
                Whether you’re an established, mid-sized organisation or a fledgling start-up, you should always set a
                budget for your website expenses. This will probably include funds for web design, programming, and web
                hosting (though other expenses may apply). Research the market by shopping around and consulting with
                professionals. Don’t sell yourself short by comparing prices alone. What you save in money you may later
                pay for with a lackluster site and lots of headaches. It’s better to choose team members based on
                experience, insightfulness, references, and examples of work.

                <li>
                    <h4>Assign roles.</h4>
                </li>
                Company stakeholders (owner, marketing manager, or whoever else represents a primary function of the
                business)
                Web developer
                Content writer and/or editor
                HTML/CSS professional
                Web and graphic designer
                Make sure everyone on your team knows their role and what is expected of them, and that they stay
                abreast of deadlines and new developments.
                <li>
                    <h4>Create a content strategy.</h4>
                </li>
                What kind of content will you be displaying on your website? Content is basically anything that gives
                your visitors information. It can include, but is not limited to:

                Blog posts
                Documents
                Video
                Pictures (such as in a gallery)
                Slideshows
                Embedded social media feeds (such as your Twitter stream or Facebook page updates)
                Your content strategy is the way that you plan to present your content over time. For instance, you may
                want to publish two blog posts a month, and put out a free quarterly report for your subscribers to
                download four times a year. Since content is such a vital aspect of a website, bring in help if you need
                it. Hire a writer who is experienced with writing for the web, and invest in some professional looking
                pictures of your storefront and employees.

                    <h4>Structure your website.</h4>
                </li>
                Decide what pages you’ll be using and what features will be on each one. Most websites have an About and
                Contact page, but the pages you use should meet your business’ needs.
                <li>
                    <h4>Create a mock-up.</h4>
                </li>
                A page mock-up, also know as a wireframe, is essentially the outline of your website (with the initial
                design being the first draft). Usually created in Photoshop or Fireworks, you don’t have to put too much
                detail into your mock-up. Use placeholder text to fill pages, and don’t worry about details. This is
                just to give everyone an idea of what the website will look like.

                If you don’t have a design program, you can also map it out with pen and paper! When you have a general
                feel of what you’d like, you can send it to a designer to create or do so yourself.
                <li>
                    <h4>Start designing.</h4>
                </li>
                The importance of good web design can’t be stressed enough. Good website design includes both usability
                and aesthetics. An ugly website will drive away visitors, as will a website that’s difficult to
                navigate. Keep in mind some basic concepts of usability as you go:

                Make your navigation easy to understand and easy to find. Research shows that most users expect website
                navigation to be vertical and centred at the top of the page.
                Use an easy-to-read font for blocks of text. Choose a background colour and text colour that contrast
                well (Hint: No red text on a hot pink background).
                Make sure your site fits the screen. Use responsive design (or an equally effective approach) to make
                your website one that adapts to all screen sizes.
                Keep your website light so that it loads quickly.
                Make the company logo and tag line prominent on the page.
                Keep styles and colours consistent across the website.
                Make copy clear and concise, and put important information and features (e.g., your newsletter sign-up
                form) above the fold.
                Make notes about what to include in the style sheet as you design, as you want to keep style and
                function separate. This is important, not only to comply with web standards, but to make it easier to
                change something in the future if you need to.
                You should also design with the future in mind. For instance, your website may only have a few blog
                posts now, but what about when you have two hundred?

                <li>
                    <h4>Test it out.</h4>
                </li>
                Testing is important for getting out bugs out and catching details that you might have missed initially.
                Make sure your website shows up the way you want it to in all browsers, including Chrome, Firefox,
                Internet Explorer, and mobile web browsers like Safari and Opera Mini. Test it on your cell phone, your
                tablet, and your colleague’s cell phones and tablets too. You want your site to have a consistent
                appearance no matter what screen it shows up on. Make sure all of the links work, that the images are
                properly sized, and that you’ve replaced all of the placeholders with actual content. See to it that all
                of the forms and other input fields are working.
                <li>
                    <h4>Maintain your site.</h4>
                </li>
                Once your site is launched, the work isn’t over. A website is an ongoing entity that continuously
                represents your company, so maintenance is very important. Monitor your analytics software to see how
                your website is performing with the public. Keep an eye on metrics like your number of unique visitors,
                bounce rate, and which pages are most popular on your website. You might find that certain metrics are
                more useful to you than others, but that is information you’ll find out over time.

                You should also have a plan for maintaining the website, such as who is responsible for posting new
                content or monitoring site security. And of course, get feedback from your users. Feedback is a valuable
                tool for improvement.

                Planning a website ahead of time is just as important as planning anything else in business, yet this
                step often gets overlooked by those anxious to claim their piece of internet real estate. Taking the
                time to plan your website is a great investment, and it will better you chances of having a finished
                product that serves you well for as long as you need it.[8]

            <h2>Types of Risks in Project Management</h2>

            <h4>Most Common Project Risks</h4>

            Cost risk, typically escalation of project costs due to poor cost estimating accuracy and scope creep.
            Schedule risk, the risk that activities will take longer than expected. Slippages in schedule typically
            increase
            costs and, also, delay the receipt of project benefits, with a possible loss of competitive advantage.

            Performance risk, the risk that the project will fail to produce results consistent with project
            specifications.

            <h4>Other Types of Risks</h4>

            There are many other types of risks of concern to projects. These risks can result in cost, schedule, or
            performance problems and create other types of adverse consequences for the organisation. For example:

            Governance risk relates to board and management performance with regard to ethics, community stewardship,
            and
            company reputation.

            Strategic risks result from errors in strategy, such as choosing a technology that can’t be made to work.

            Operational risk includes risks from poor implementation and process problems such as procurement,
            production,
            and distribution.

            Market risks include competition, foreign exchange, commodity markets, and interest rate risk, as well as
            liquidity and credit risks.

            Legal risks arise from legal and regulatory obligations, including contract risks and litigation brought
            against
            the organisation.

            Risks associated with external hazards, including storms, floods, and earthquakes; vandalism, sabotage, and
            terrorism; labor strikes; and civil unrest.

            In addition to project risk, project deferral risk can be important. Project deferral risk refers to the
            risks
            associated with failing to do a project. if the project is not conducted now, there may be a risk that it
            might
            never be possible to effectively do it later.

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>

            Oftentimes, external risks contribute more to portfolio risk because they impact multiple projects
            simultaneously.[9]

            <h2>Selecting The Right Software</h2>
            <br>
            I have used the following software to create my website.

            Trello has an intriguing interface that resembles solitaire (you can even drag task cards across columns,
            just like you would playing cards). It’s easy to learn and works well for monitoring projects and assigning
            tasks. Trello also makes using Agile, Scrum and other project management frameworks easy.

            Slack is a popular and well-crafted platform offering instant messaging, file transfers and powerful message
            search. It has many features and dozens of integrations with other tools like Trello and Intercom.[4]

            Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a source code editor with powerful developer tooling, like
            IntelliSense code completion and debugging.

            First and foremost, it is an editor that gets out of your way. The delightfully frictionless
            edit-build-debug cycle means less time fiddling with your environment, and more time executing on your
            ideas.[10]
